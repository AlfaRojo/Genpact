*VBA test by Kevin Ramírez

Built on VB with .Net Core
.exe file can be found on Publish

A very challenge test, but nothing that I can handle. The DB is from csv files, and the hide and unhide macros are the .txt
on this root, I´m not sure if the macros are saved on the file or if you have to export them I never work with them, but I
got it!
